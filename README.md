# Final-Project
##Final Project for Drawing on the Web

In this final project, I am trying to explore the relationship between reality and illusion. 
Through the three drawings, I want to demonstrate the evolvement of female portraits in art history, among different but representative art historical periods and styles: realism, surrealism, and cubism. More specifically, I will select three paintings representing each period, which are Antonio del Pollaiuolo’s Profile Portrait of a Young Lady (1465), Frida Kahlo’s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940), and Pablo Picasso’s Portrait of Dora Maar (1937).

The web drawings are reproductions of the original paintings. I will keep the painted female sitter and replace some components on the original canvases, such as the backgrounds and supplementary elements, with natural landscapes or geometric shapes. Mixing realistic and abstract elements together, I hope to establish a conversation between the seemingly unrelated art styles, and connect the material world to an illusional fantasy. 

From the technical perspective, I will mainly use HTML and CSS to structure the web collages. I will also incorporate SVG or HTML canvas to create the geometric shapes. Each drawing will include some forms of animation, using CSS or canvas animation. The navigational Interface will be more interactive, accomplished by some Javascript controls.
